    <section>
        <p>
            You may write me down in history
            With your bitter, twisted lies,
            You may trod me in the very dirt
            But still, like dust, I'll rise.

        <p>
            Does my sassiness upset you?
            Why are you beset with gloom?
            â€™Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
            Pumping in my living room.
